# TGSV - interactive, proof-of-concept tour of Toowoomba Grammar School (TGS)
A virtual tour of TGS written in JavaScript and HTML using the Google Maps API and 360-degree imagery taken on-site.

The project was written by @Pl4nty for the TGS Young Creator of the Year Award.

Development has ended, but improvements can be committed to the dev branch (and are very much appreciated).

The Google Maps JavaScript API docs (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) were invaluable during development.
