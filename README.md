# TGSV - interactive, proof-of-concept tour of Toowoomba Grammar School (TGS)
A virtual tour of TGS written in JavaScript and HTML using the Google Maps API and 360-degree imagery taken on-site.

The project was written by @Pl4nty for the TGS Young Creator of the Year Award.

The Google Maps JavaScript API docs (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) were invaluable during development.
